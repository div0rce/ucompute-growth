# ADR-0003: Peer identity, pairing, transport and discovery (M3); carriage of llama.cpp RPC (M4)

Names: this record uses the current names (D-030). What it describes ran under the former name; the original text is in git history (commit cab8a09 and earlier).

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-14
- **Inputs:** `docs/SPEC_HANDOFF_V2.md` sections 6, 7, 9; ledger rows F-02-01..12, F-06-01/02/03/05/10, F-08-10, F-03-01, F-03-03, X-20; ADR-0001 (stack table), ADR-0002 (supervised `llama-server`, D-007); `docs/research/COMPETITIVE_MATRIX.md`, `RESEARCH_GAPS.md`; crates.io metadata and downloaded crate sources read on 2026-10-14 (section 11).
- **Markers:** ✅ verified this session from a primary source · ⚠️ secondary/partial · `unverified` not checked.
- **Implementation:** M3 was built on 2026-10-15 and tested SINGLE-HOST only. Section 9 describes the code. Where section 9 and sections 2–8 disagree, section 9 is what runs.

## 1. Context

M3 must let trusted devices on one LAN discover each other, pair with a short code, authenticate each other's keys, and talk over an encrypted transport with no plaintext path, offline (X-20), with no central service (spec section 6). M4 must carry llama.cpp's RPC layer-offload traffic between two hosts through that transport, because `ggml-rpc-server` is unauthenticated plaintext TCP and its own README says never expose it (COMPETITIVE_MATRIX; D-007). Only one physical machine exists (B-002), so every test in this ADR is labelled `SINGLE-HOST` unless stated otherwise (D-004).

Threat model for M3 (spec section 9), what this ADR defends against: a passive or active attacker on the LAN (reads, injects, replays, spoofs mDNS); an unpaired device trying to connect; a revoked device trying to reconnect; an active MITM during pairing; a peer flooding pairing or streams. **Not defended** and documented honestly: a trusted peer that is compromised sees, inside its own process, the activations and the layer weights it computes on; TLS does not hide prompts from a peer processing them (spec section 9). Confidential computing and verifiable inference remain M14 research (F-06-11, F-06-12).

Dependency-count proxy for binary size (`cargo tree -e normal`, scratch projects, **no build**): quinn 0.11.12 + rustls(ring) + spake2 + mdns-sd + prost = **91** crates; iroh 1.3.0 default = **315**; libp2p 0.57 with quic/tls/noise/mdns/identify/ping/dcutr/relay = **254**. Binary size itself `unverified` (no build permitted this session).

Pinned engine facts: `llama-b11609-bin-macos-arm64` ships `ggml-rpc-server` and `libggml-rpc` ✅; `ggml-rpc-server --help` shows `-H/--host (default 127.0.0.1)`, `-p/--port (default 50052)`, `-d/--device`, `-t/--threads`, `-c/--cache`; **no memory-cap flag** ✅. Started on this Mac it listened on `127.0.0.1:50999` only (lsof) ✅. `llama-server` accepts `--rpc host:port[,…]`, `-ngl`, `-ts/--tensor-split` ✅. RPC protocol version string of b11609 `unverified` (stdout buffering swallowed the banner; COMPETITIVE_MATRIX saw v3.6.0 at b8241 ⚠️).

## 3. Decision

### D1 Identity (F-06-01)
1. One **Ed25519 device keypair**, generated and used through `ring` (same crypto provider as TLS, one Ed25519 implementation in the binary). `PeerId = [u8; 32]` raw public key.
2. **Storage: file, not keychain.** `Paths::identity()` already resolves `UCOMPUTE_HOME/identity` (ucompute-core). Layout: `identity/device.key` (PKCS#8 v2 DER, mode `0600`, directory `0700`, written tmp+rename), `identity/device.pub` (64 lowercase hex). Secret type has no `Serialize`, `Debug` prints `Ed25519Secret(<redacted>)`; the F-06-01 grep test runs over logs and diagnostics bundles.
   - Keychain (macOS Keychain / Secret Service / Windows Credential Manager via `keyring` 4.2.0) rejected for M3: Keychain ACLs bind to the code signature and we have no signing identity (B-008), so every rebuilt unsigned daemon re-prompts or is denied; headless/launchd daemons and Linux servers without a D-Bus session cannot use it; MSRV 1.88 > workspace 1.85; `0600` is what the F-06-01 criterion also accepts. Revisit when signed installers exist (M13).
3. **Fingerprint shown to users:** the key itself, no hash step. Canonical id = 64 lowercase hex (same encoding as iroh's `EndpointId` display ⚠️, so a later iroh adapter needs no conversion). Short label = first 12 hex as `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` (labels only; never a trust decision). The pairing confirmation screen shows the full 64 hex in 8 groups of 8.

### D2 Pairing (F-02-02)
Protocol `ucompute-pair/1`, run over a QUIC connection on a **separate pairing endpoint** (own UDP port) that exists only while the device is in pairing mode (default 120 s window):

| Step | Initiator A ("pair this device", shows code) | Joiner B (enters code) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `ucompute pair` → generates code, opens pairing endpoint, advertises `pair=1,pairport=` in mDNS TXT | picks A from discovery (or QR) |
| 1 | QUIC/TLS 1.3 handshake, raw public keys both ways, verifier **accepts any key on the pairing endpoint only**; both learn the other's `PeerId` from the TLS RPK | same |
| 2 | SPAKE2 `start_a(pw=code, idA=PeerId_A, idB=PeerId_B)` → 33-byte message | `start_b(...)` → message |
| 3 | `K = finish(msg_B)`; `ekm = conn.export_keying_material(32, "ucompute-pair/1 confirm", "")` (quinn `Connection::export_keying_material` ✅) | same on its own TLS session |
| 4 | sends `HMAC-SHA256(K, "A" ‖ ekm ‖ PeerId_A ‖ PeerId_B)` | sends the `"B"` variant; each verifies the other |
| 5 | pins `PeerId_B` into SQLite `peers` (name, group, paired_at); code invalidated; audit `pairing_succeeded` | pins `PeerId_A` |

- **MITM detection:** a relay that terminates TLS on both legs presents its own RPK, so `idA/idB` and `ekm` differ per leg; without the code it cannot compute `K`, and even with the code the confirmation MACs bind each leg's exporter value, so step 4 fails on both sides (test `mitm_relay_detected`).
- **Code:** 6 decimal digits, single use, valid 120 s. QR payload = `ucompute-pair:v1:<PeerId_A hex>:<ip:pairport>:<128-bit secret hex>`; the secret replaces the 6-digit code as the PAKE password.
- **Rate limit:** more than 5 failed confirmations within any 60 s window → pairing endpoint closes, code discarded, `PairingLocked` for the remainder of the window, audit `pairing_locked` (test `brute_force_rate_limited`). Expected attacker success per window ≤ 5 × 10⁻⁶.
- **Why spake2 0.4.0 despite its caveats:** the PAKE protects a one-time 120 s secret and only authenticates the pairing transcript; long-term security rests on TLS 1.3 + Ed25519 pinning. Its key already hashes both identities and both messages (transcript binding ✅). We add the confirmation round it leaves to the caller. Not RFC 9382 wire-compatible (python-spake2 variant) ✅, which is irrelevant for UCompute-to-UCompute pairing. Re-evaluate `spake2` 0.5 when released; OPAQUE/CPace rejected (no need for augmented PAKE; CPace has no mature Rust crate `unverified`).

### D3 Transport (F-02-03, F-06-03): **QUIC via quinn 0.11 + rustls 0.23, raw public keys, mutual auth, TLS 1.3 only**
- `rustls` features `["ring","std","logging"]`, **no `tls12`, no `aws-lc-rs`** (avoids the C/cmake build on the 8 GB dev Mac; one feature flag switches provider if `ring` stalls). `quinn` features `["runtime-tokio","rustls-ring","log"]`, no `platform-verifier`.
- Server: `ServerConfig::builder_with_provider(ring).with_protocol_versions(&[&TLS13]).with_client_cert_verifier(PinnedPeerVerifier).with_cert_resolver(AlwaysResolvesServerRawPublicKeys)`. Client: `.dangerous().with_custom_certificate_verifier(PinnedPeerVerifier).with_client_cert_resolver(AlwaysResolvesClientRawPublicKeys)`. `PinnedPeerVerifier::requires_raw_public_keys() = true`, `client_auth_mandatory() = true`, schemes `[ED25519]`, verification via `verify_tls13_signature_with_raw_key`; it parses the SPKI into a `PeerId` and accepts iff `peers` contains it and `revoked` does not. **An unpinned key fails inside the TLS handshake** (test `unpinned_key_rejected`). No X.509, no CA, no rcgen.
- Two endpoints, one verifier policy each: workload endpoint (strict, ALPN `ucompute/1`, default UDP 8193, created only when `[network] enabled = true`, default `false`) and pairing endpoint (accept-any, ALPN `ucompute-pair/1`, ephemeral port, exists only in pairing mode). Avoids ALPN-conditional verification inside one verifier.
- 0-RTT disabled (no `into_0rtt`, `max_early_data_size = 0`), datagrams disabled, `keep_alive_interval = 2 s`, `max_idle_timeout = 6 s`, `stream_receive_window = 8 MiB`, `receive_window = 64 MiB`, `max_concurrent_bidi_streams = 64` (all `[network.transport]` config; defaults chosen for F-02-05, tune after measurement).
- **No plaintext path, by construction and by test:** `ucompute-network` owns exactly one socket kind (the quinn `Endpoint`). The only TCP code in `ucompute-distributed` is the loopback RPC bridge (D6), whose bind/connect asserts `ip.is_loopback()`. CI test `no_plaintext_mode_exists` greps `TcpListener::bind|TcpStream::connect|UdpSocket::bind` across both crates and fails on anything outside that module. QUIC has no cleartext mode; a client offering another ALPN or TLS 1.2 fails the handshake (`downgrade_attempt_fails`).
- **Proving a capture contains no plaintext (F-02-03 acceptance):** run a remote inference whose prompt and expected completion contain unique canaries (`CANARY-<random>`); `tcpdump -i lo0 -w` (SINGLE-HOST) or on the LAN interface; assert zero matches for the canaries (UTF-8 and UTF-16) in every UDP payload. Positive control in the same test: the identical search against a capture of the local `llama-server` HTTP hop on loopback **must** find the canaries, proving the search works. Debug-only `rustls::KeyLogFile` + Wireshark decryption may be used to show the ciphertext did carry the canaries (never in release builds). QUIC Initial packets are only obfuscated, not secret: they carry the ClientHello (ALPN, no SNI secret); the test asserts no canary there too.
- **M9 (F-02-06) adds**, without changing M3 code paths: a `Transport` seam at the level of `(Connection, open_bi, accept_bi)` so that iroh (`iroh::endpoint::Connection` has the same shape) can be a second implementation for hole punching and relays. Identity is already byte-compatible (Ed25519, hex id, RFC 7250 on both sides ✅). The alternative is a dumb UDP relay of our own: QUIC end-to-end encryption continues through it, so the relay sees ciphertext only, by construction. Decide in M9 with a NAT-matrix test.

### D4 LAN discovery (F-02-01): `mdns-sd` 0.21.5
- Service `_ucompute._udp.local.`, instance `<short id 12 hex>`, SRV → workload port, TXT (all ≤ 255 B, record < 1472 B): `v=1`, `id=<64 hex PeerId>`, `pair=0|1`, `pairport=<n>` (only while pairing), `proto=1.0`, `ts=<unix s>`, `sig=<Ed25519 over the other TXT values, base64>`. **No hostname beyond SRV, no model names, no hardware, no user names** — those go only over the authenticated channel.
- Unsigned, badly signed or > 300 s old records are ignored; records whose `id` is not pinned are listed as **untrusted** and can never receive work (the verifier enforces this independently). Spoofing only yields a failed handshake.
- Config: `[network] mdns = false` disables advertising and browsing; `UCOMPUTE_MDNS=0` for tests; `[network] enabled = false` (default) implies no mDNS.

### D5 Protocol framing and versioning (F-08-10, F-03-03): **length-prefixed protobuf (prost) for control; fixed binary header for bulk**
- Control stream = first bidirectional stream opened by the connector. Frame = `u32 BE length ‖ protobuf ControlMessage { oneof: Hello, Capabilities, Status, SessionOpen/Accept/Close, StreamOpen, Revocation, Error }`. Hard bound 1 MiB per control frame (close with `FRAME_TOO_LARGE`); `Capabilities` ≤ 64 KiB (F-02-04).
- `Hello{major=1, minor, ucompute_version, peer_id, nonce}` first in both directions. Major is also the ALPN (`ucompute/1`): an incompatible major fails ALPN negotiation and maps to `ErrorCode::ProtocolIncompatible` with a message naming both versions and the device to update. Compatible minors use `min(minor)`. Unknown protobuf fields and unknown `oneof` variants are skipped by prost ✅ (not preserved on re-encode ⚠️, acceptable).
- Schemas live in `proto/ucompute/v1/*.proto`; **generated Rust is committed** (regenerated by `scripts/gen_proto.sh`), so no build-time `protoc` dependency. tonic/gRPC is **not** on the peer path: gRPC needs HTTP/2 over TCP or HTTP/3, i.e. a second transport stack.
- Bulk/activation frames (UCompute-native stage protocol, later than M4): fixed 32-byte header `magic "CACT", u8 version, u8 dtype, u16 flags, u32 request_id, u32 seq, u32 n_tokens, u32 hidden_dim, u32 payload_len, u32 crc32c` + raw payload → framing overhead ≤ 64 B as F-03-03 requires; payload bound 64 MiB default; wrong `hidden_dim` or oversize is rejected without a crash.
- postcard/bincode rejected: not self-describing, adding a field breaks old peers, which F-08-10 forbids; bincode 3.0 is a 10-month-old major with a new API. Protobuf also serves the mobile companion and web app.

### D6 Carrying llama.cpp RPC for genuine layer partitioning (M4, F-03-01, F-03-03)
```
head host H                                   remote host R
llama-server --rpc 127.0.0.1:pL ──TCP lo0──▶ ucompute RpcBridge(listen 127.0.0.1:pL)
                                             │ one QUIC bidi stream per accepted TCP connection
                                             ▼  (authenticated, encrypted; StreamOpen{RPC_TUNNEL, session_id})
                            ucompute ◀──QUIC/UDP LAN──▶ ucompute ──TCP lo0──▶ ggml-rpc-server -H 127.0.0.1 -p pR
```
- **Remote:** UCompute supervises `ggml-rpc-server -H 127.0.0.1 -p <ephemeral> [-d dev] [-t n]` exactly like `llama-server` in ADR-0002 (pinned archive, scrubbed env, log parsing); startup test asserts the listening socket is loopback (`rpc_server_binds_loopback_only`). It is started per accepted `SessionOpen{model_sha256, layer_range, est_bytes, engine_build}` and only for a peer whose group policy allows `pooled_inference` (F-06-02 default deny); `engine_build` must equal the local pinned build, since the ggml RPC protocol version is coupled to the llama.cpp build.
- **Head:** `RpcBridge` listens on `127.0.0.1:<pL>` and the supervised `llama-server` is started with `--rpc 127.0.0.1:<pL>` plus `-ngl`/`--tensor-split` from the plan. Each accepted TCP connection → `open_bi()` on the peer connection, `StreamOpen` frame, then `tokio::io::copy_bidirectional`. TCP FIN ↔ stream FIN; TCP RST ↔ `reset(code)`. The number of TCP connections ggml opens is an implementation detail we do not depend on (`unverified`; bounded by `max_tunnels_per_session = 8`).
- **Bounds:** per-session `max_tunnels` 8; tunnel idle timeout 120 s (a long remote `GRAPH_COMPUTE` is silent on the socket ⚠️ tune by measurement); per-peer bytes/s token bucket from F-06-04 policy (default unlimited on LAN; model-load bursts of GBs must not be throttled by default); QUIC flow-control windows from D3 bound memory in flight.
- **Failure semantics:** peer connection lost (6 s idle) → bridge resets all local TCP connections → ggml's RPC client errors; llama.cpp aborts on many RPC errors ⚠️ → the ADR-0002 supervisor sees the engine exit, fails in-flight requests with `ErrorCode::PeerLost`, and re-plans. Automatic fallback to local-only is allowed **only** with the identical model hash and quantization and only if it fits; otherwise the error is surfaced (spec: no silent substitution; F-02-10). Remote side: tunnel closed → rpc-server client disconnect; if rpc-server exits (known crash reports, COMPETITIVE_MATRIX) the supervisor restarts it and the session is marked failed. Both sides write audit entries.
- **Honest data-exposure note (spec section 9):** R receives, in plaintext inside `ggml-rpc-server`, the weights of its layer range (uploaded by the head at load, or read from its `-c` tensor cache on disk `unverified` details) and every activation crossing the boundary. Encryption protects the wire, not the peer. The UI must say "device R will compute part of this model and can see intermediate data" before the first pooled run; the tensor cache on R is a model-redistribution event for license policy (X-08).
- **Measurement plan.** The bridge counts bytes per direction per tunnel and session, exported as Prometheus metrics (crate already in the workspace) and written into the run record with `quinn::Connection::stats()` (udp tx/rx, lost, rtt ✅).
  - *bytes per token per boundary (F-03-03):* after prefill, decode N = 64 tokens greedily; `(Δbytes_tx, Δbytes_rx)/N`. Compare with the arithmetic floor `hidden_dim × element_size` (llama.cpp inter-layer activations are f32 ⚠️, e.g. 4096 × 4 = 16 KiB). Run two models with different `hidden_dim` to separate the per-token constant (ggml re-serialises the graph per compute call ⚠️) from the activation term. Report both.
  - *activation transfer overhead (bench):* TPOT with the split vs the same model local-only (when it fits); and `llama-server --rpc` **directly** to `ggml-rpc-server` over loopback TCP (plaintext control, SINGLE-HOST only) vs through the UCompute tunnel over loopback QUIC → isolates CPU cost of QUIC + AEAD, the lower bound for H1 (≤ 5 %). The LAN number needs the second machine (B-002).
  - *load transfer:* bytes and seconds for cold (weights uploaded) vs warm (`-c` cache) load.
  - **Ledger consequence:** F-03-03's "equal to hidden_dim × element_size (+ ≤ 64 B)" is satisfiable only by the UCompute-native frame of D5, not by RPC carriage, which has its own protocol overhead. Proposal for the owner: split F-03-03 into (a) native frame format (unit-testable in M4 without a second host) and (b) measured bytes/token on RPC carriage with the overhead ratio reported. Not changed here (D-005: no silent criterion changes).

### D7 Health, capabilities, revocation, audit
- **Health (F-02-05):** liveness = QUIC keep-alive 2 s / idle 6 s; three missed keep-alives = connection timeout ≤ 6 s (`kill_peer_detected_within_bound`). State machine `Connected → Unhealthy → Reconnecting (1,2,4,8…30 s backoff) → Connected`. A `Status` control message every 10 s carries volatile load (free memory, active sessions, queue depth); it refreshes capability fields, it is not the liveness signal.
- **Capabilities (F-02-04), sent right after `Hello`, ≤ 64 KiB, Ed25519-signed so M9 can relay/cache it (F-02-11):**
  ```proto
  message Capabilities { uint32 schema_version=1; bytes peer_id=2; string ucompute_version=3;
    repeated ProtocolVersion protocols=4;        // name, major, minor
    Hardware hardware=5;                         // same struct as `ucompute hardware --json` (F-01-01)
    uint64 free_memory_bytes=6; repeated EngineBuild engines=7;   // "llama.cpp", "b11609", "macos-arm64", rpc_proto
    repeated bytes cached_model_sha256=8; repeated string groups=9; uint64 issued_at=10; bytes signature=11; }
  ```
  Test: the record received equals the peer's own `ucompute hardware --json`; a 64 KiB + 1 record is rejected and logged.
- **Revocation (F-06-05):** `ucompute peers revoke <id>` deletes the pin, inserts into `revoked(peer_id, seq, revoked_by, sig, at)`, closes every connection to that peer with close code `REVOKED` (≤ 5 s via `Connection::close`), and sends `Revocation{...}` signed by the revoker to every connected group member, which verifies the signature against a pinned member key and applies the same steps. On every reconnect peers exchange `revocations_since(seq)` so offline members converge. The verifier consults `revoked` on each handshake, so reconnection fails (`revoked_key_cannot_reconnect`). M3 policy: any member of a group may revoke any other member (household model); per-group admin policy is an open question (F-02-09).
- **Key rotation (spec section 9):** `Rotation{old_id, new_id, sig_old, sig_new}` over the control stream, treated like a pin update; designed here, implemented when F-06 rows require it.
- **Audit hooks (F-06-10):** `ucompute_observability::audit::record(AuditEvent)` appends one JSON line to `UCOMPUTE_HOME/logs/audit.jsonl` (0600). Events: `pairing_{started,succeeded,failed,locked}`, `peer_{connected,disconnected{reason},rejected{reason}}`, `peer_revoked`, `session_{open,close}{peer_id,model_sha256,layers}`, `rpc_tunnel_{open,close}{bytes_tx,bytes_rx,duration}`, `remote_request{request_id,peer_id,bytes}`. Never prompt text, token strings or key material; the bundle redaction scan (F-06-10) runs over this file too.
- **Error codes** added to the existing `ucompute_core::ErrorCode`: `PeerUnauthorized`, `PeerRevoked`, `PairingLocked`, `PairingFailed`, `PeerLost`, `ProtocolIncompatible`, `FrameTooLarge`.

| Central services by default | none | `presets::N0` → n0.computer DNS/pkarr/relays ✅; must use `presets::Minimal` + `RelayMode::Disabled` for X-20 | none required | none |
| LAN discovery | mdns-sd (separate, ours) | external crate `unverified` | built-in mDNS behaviour | mdns-sd |
| NAT traversal / relays (M9) | **not included**: own UDP relay or iroh adapter later | included; ~90 % hole-punch vendor-reported ⚠️; relays carry ciphertext (by construction, `unverified` by us) | DCUtR + circuit relay `unverified` | none |
| Two QUIC stacks risk | — | `noq` fork beside quinn if mixed with reqwest/h3 ⚠️ | uses quinn ✅ | — |

**Why not iroh now:** M3 is LAN-only and offline-first, where iroh's differentiators (hole punching, relays, global discovery) are unused, while its costs (MSRV 1.91, 3.5× dependency count, central-service presets that must be switched off, authorisation after the handshake, a forked QUIC stack) are paid immediately. Because both use RFC 7250 Ed25519 raw public keys, the M9 switch, if measurements favour it, is an adapter, not a redesign. **Why not libp2p:** we need two protocols between a handful of trusted devices, not a swarm framework; identity encoding and X.509 shim add friction. **Why not Noise:** QUIC gives streams, flow control, loss recovery, keep-alive and idle timeout (F-02-05) for free.

## 5. Test plan

Fixtures: the TinyStories models (`docs/research/TEST_MODELS.md`) for all SINGLE-HOST functional tests; no mocked inference (AGENTS.md).

## 6. Consequences
- New direct dependencies: `quinn`, `rustls`, `ring` (already resolved in `Cargo.lock`), `spake2`, `mdns-sd`, `prost`, `hmac`/`sha2` (RustCrypto, for confirmation MACs), `rusqlite` (bundled) for `peers`/`revoked`. Workspace `rust-version = "1.85"` is unchanged. No C/cmake builds added.
- New crates per spec section 6: `ucompute-identity` (D1, D2, pins, revocation), `ucompute-network` (D3–D5, D7), `ucompute-distributed` (D6, M4), `ucompute-observability::audit`, `proto/` with committed generated code.
- Every pin here is re-verified against the upstream LICENSE file before Gate G (ADR-0001 rule); cargo-deny allowlist must include `ISC` and `BSD-3-Clause` (already proposed).
- The remote peer's plaintext view of activations/weights is a documented product fact (UI consent text, X-08 policy), not a bug.

## 7. Risks and open questions
1. **rustls 0.24** (dev release the day of this ADR) and the quinn release that follows: pin `0.23`/`0.11`, budget one migration before M13. **ring** inactivity: provider switch to `aws-lc-rs` is one feature flag but reintroduces a C build.
2. **spake2 0.4.0** is 3 years old, unaudited, not constant-time (self-declared). Mitigated by one-time short-lived codes, lock-out and transcript-only use; track 0.5.
3. `ggml-rpc-server` has **no memory cap flag** in b11609; remote memory is bounded only by the session estimate and RSS monitoring. llama.cpp aborts on RPC errors ⚠️ → every peer loss is an engine restart until a native stage protocol exists.
4. The ggml RPC protocol version is coupled to the engine build; only identical pinned builds may pool. Capability record enforces it; cross-platform builds need B-004 hosts.
5. mDNS with two instances on one host, Wi-Fi power-save RTT jitter versus the 6 s idle timeout, macOS UDP throughput (GSO/GRO) — all unmeasured; defaults are configurable.
6. Open: who may revoke in enterprise groups (F-02-09 policy); whether M9 uses an iroh adapter or an own relay; whether to split F-03-03 as proposed in D6; whether the desktop app's embedded daemon needs the pairing endpoint on IPv6 link-local too.

## 8. Verification record
- **Verified (✅):** all versions, dates, licenses and MSRVs in section 2 (crates.io API + `cargo info`, 2026-10-14); rustls RPK API and iroh RPK/presets/`RelayMode::Disabled` (downloaded crate sources); quinn `peer_identity`/`export_keying_material`/`stats` (source + docs.rs via Context7); spake2 0.4.0 key derivation and absence of confirmation (source + docs.rs); `ggml-rpc-server` flags, default loopback bind and presence in the pinned archive (run on this Mac); dependency counts (`cargo tree`, no build); `/dev/bpf0` root-only; quinn/rustls/ring already in `Cargo.lock`.
- **Unverified / secondary:** binary-size deltas; iroh relay ciphertext-only claim and hole-punch rate (vendor); iroh mDNS crate behaviour; b11609 RPC protocol version string; ggml RPC connection count, graph re-serialisation per compute, inter-layer activation dtype, `-c` cache semantics, abort-on-error behaviour; mdns-sd multi-instance on one host; prost unknown-field handling details beyond "skipped on decode".

## 9. Implementation notes (2026-10-15)

What M3 built, decision by decision, and the tests that hold each rule in place. Every test is a unit test or a **SINGLE-HOST** test on the owner's one Mac. None is two-machine evidence (B-002). SINGLE-HOST evidence never satisfies a criterion that needs two machines (F-02-01 LAN discovery, F-03-01, F-03-02, Gate D, two installs pairing through the UI). Rows whose criteria do not depend on topology (pairing cryptography, policy, revocation, capture, liveness) were marked `VERIFIED` from SINGLE-HOST tests on 2026-10-15; see `docs/REQUIREMENTS.csv`. Test names are function names; the file is given once per group. The 2026-10-15 two-daemon run is in `docs/evidence/m3-single-host-2026-10-15.md`.

### 9.1 D1 Identity
- One Ed25519 key per device, through `ring`. `identity/device.key` is PKCS#8 v2, mode 0600, in a 0700 directory, written tmp + rename. A loosened mode is tightened on load. A corrupt key file is an error, never a silent new identity.
- The trust store is `identity/peers.json` (0600), not SQLite. It holds pins, groups, revocations, superseded revocations and the next revocation `seq`.
- Writers take `peers.json.lock`, re-read the file, then write by rename. Readers reload when the file changes. So `ucompute peers revoke` in another process reaches the daemon's TLS verifier at its next handshake.
- The secret has no `Serialize`; `Debug` prints `Ed25519Secret(<redacted>)`. Key bytes are not zeroized on drop (open, 9.15).
- Tests, `crates/ucompute-identity/src/lib.rs`: `keygen_persist_load`, `file_permissions_0600`, `corrupt_key_file_is_an_error_not_a_new_identity`, `private_key_never_logged`, `debug_redacts_secret`, `sign_verify_roundtrip`, `spki_round_trip`, `peer_store_persists_across_reopen`, `stale_handle_does_not_undo_another_handles_revocation`, `concurrent_handles_lose_no_update`, `failed_write_leaves_store_unchanged`. `crates/ucompute-network/tests/invariants.rs`: `private_keys_never_formatted`. `crates/ucompute-cli/tests/mesh_single_host.rs`: `private_key_absent_from_real_logs_and_bundle_single_host`, with its positive control `key_scan_catches_every_claimed_encoding_synthetic_key`.

### 9.2 D2 Pairing
The order, as built:
1. The initiator A opens a pairing endpoint: its bind address, an ephemeral UDP port, ALPN `ucompute-pair/1`, a verifier that accepts any key. The window is 120 s. mDNS advertises `pair=1` and `pairport` while it is open.
2. The joiner B dials from its own workload endpoint, so pairing adds only A's socket. With a QR payload, B's verifier accepts only the key in the QR. Any other device fails **inside the TLS handshake**, before SPAKE2: `pairing_failed`, audit reason `qr_peer_mismatch`, nothing pinned on either side, no revocation touched.
3. B → A: one selector byte (0 = 6-digit code, 1 = QR secret) and SPAKE2 `msg_B`. A → B: `msg_A`. Frames are `u8 length ‖ bytes`.
4. Both read `ekm` = TLS exporter, 32 bytes, label `ucompute-pair/1 confirm`. Each sends `HMAC-SHA256(K, side ‖ ekm ‖ idA ‖ idB)` and checks the other's MAC in constant time.
5. **Only after a verified MAC** do both send `u16 workload port ‖ device name` (at most 64 bytes, control characters removed). A party without the code never learns either.
6. Both call `pin_after_pairing` (which also supersedes local revocations of that id, 9.9) and audit `pairing_succeeded`.

Bounds:
- The code is 6 digits, uniform (rejection sampling), single use. The QR payload is `ucompute-pair:v1:<id hex>:<ip:port>:<32 hex secret>`. When the endpoint binds every interface, the QR carries this host's LAN address instead of `0.0.0.0` (if it has one).
- A handles one attempt at a time; each has 10 s. Every failed exchange counts, not only wrong MACs. The 6th failure within 60 s closes the endpoint with `pairing_locked` (close code `PL`).
- The pairing endpoint does not send QUIC Retry (9.3). The lockout and the one-at-a-time loop bound it.
- Turning networking off closes an open window (`cancelled`). `ucompute peers pair|join` refuse while a daemon runs; pairing then goes through the daemon API.
- Tests, `crates/ucompute-network/tests/pairing.rs`: `correct_code_pairs_and_pins_both_sides_single_host`, `wrong_code_fails_and_pins_nothing`, `brute_force_rate_limited`, `wrong_code_learns_no_name_or_port`, `mitm_relay_detected`, `qr_payload_from_wildcard_bind_pairs_single_host`, `qr_expected_peer_mismatch_pins_nothing_single_host`. `crates/ucompute-network/src/pairing.rs`: `code_and_secret_have_the_documented_shape`, `qr_payload_parses_and_rejects_garbage`, `qr_address_is_routable`, `confirmation_mac_binds_side_exporter_and_ids`, `names_are_printable_and_bounded`. `crates/ucompute-api/tests/mesh.rs`: `pairing_pins_both_sides_and_revoke_closes_the_connection_single_host`, `qr_join_pairs_and_a_qr_for_another_device_pins_nothing_single_host`, `turning_networking_off_closes_an_open_pairing_window`. `crates/ucompute-api/src/mesh.rs`: `routable_replaces_only_the_unspecified_address`.

### 9.3 D3 Transport
Built as decided: quinn 0.11.12, rustls 0.23.45 with `ring`, RFC 7250 raw public keys both ways, mutual auth, TLS 1.3 only, Ed25519 only, no X.509. In detail:
- **The verdict is inside the handshake.** Unpinned key → alert `unknown_ca` → `peer_unauthorized`. Revoked key → `certificate_revoked` → `peer_revoked` on the refusing side (the refused dialler reads it as `peer_unauthorized` since 2026-10-22, next item). No stream opens. A dialler accepts only the one key it expects; another pinned key fails too.
- **Which refusals a dialler believes (2026-10-21, tightened twice on 2026-10-22 and again on 2026-10-23).** A refusal is the pinned device's own verdict only after the dialler has read that device's Hello on the control stream. Until then the dialler still processes QUIC Initial packets, whose keys derive from the public connection id: quinn-proto 0.11.19 drops them only when the client builds its first Handshake packet, after it has processed the server's flight. So any close, a TLS alert as well as an application code, can be forged on the path even after the pinned key was shown, its signature checked and the handshake completed. An unproven refusal reads "the device at <addr> did not prove it is <name>" (`peer_unauthorized`) and the dial goes on to the next address. Every unproven close but a plain loss reads that way, including one that claims a protocol mismatch (`CLOSE_PROTOCOL`, or a TLS alert such as `no_application_protocol`; since 780c2b9), whose hint adds "if it is that device, update UCompute on both devices". So `protocol_incompatible` (426) is always proven: a Hello was read, or this side's own negotiation failed. A proven refusal ends the dial, so a later timeout cannot replace it as the device's `last_error`: `ErrorMsg{peer_held}` read on the control stream, a close after the Hello, or this store's own verdict (`allowed`, register, this verifier's `certificate_revoked`). Consequences: when the other device's TLS verifier refuses a key it revoked, the dialler reads `peer_unauthorized`, not `peer_revoked`; a minor-1 device held by a minor-0 build (which closes with `CLOSE_HELD` before sending its Hello) reads `peer_unauthorized`, not `peer_held`; a genuinely newer-major device that closes before its Hello reads `peer_unauthorized` with the update hint. Tests, `crates/ucompute-network/src/transport.rs`: `a_close_before_the_device_proved_its_key_proves_nothing` (renamed from `application_close_during_the_handshake_proves_nothing`), `connection_errors_map_to_stable_codes`. `crates/ucompute-network/tests/peer_transport.rs`: `a_close_forged_after_the_genuine_flight_is_not_a_refusal_single_host` (an in-process loopback relay appends a forged Initial close, `certificate_revoked`, `CLOSE_HELD`, `CLOSE_PROTOCOL` or `no_application_protocol`, to the genuine server flight), `supervise_retries_after_an_unproven_refusal_single_host`, `protocol_major_mismatch_is_typed` (a mismatch proven after the Hello still reads `protocol_incompatible`), `forged_revoked_alert_before_the_key_is_not_a_revocation`. `crates/ucompute-api/tests/mesh.rs`: `a_refusal_before_the_device_proved_its_key_does_not_end_the_dial_single_host` (replaces `revoked_alert_from_the_pinned_key_ends_the_dial_single_host`), `a_held_refusal_ends_the_dial_single_host`. Closed in 780c2b9: `health::supervise` no longer treats `peer_unauthorized` as final (9.8), and a forged `protocol_incompatible` close no longer counts as proven.
- **No session resumption.** No tickets, no server session cache, client resumption off. A resumed TLS 1.3 handshake skips the client verifier, so a revoked device could otherwise return with a cached ticket.
- 0-RTT off, datagrams off. Windows: 8 MiB per stream, 64 MiB per connection, 64 bidirectional streams.
- **QUIC Retry before TLS.** The workload endpoint answers every Initial from an unvalidated source address with a Retry. A spoofed source cannot answer it, so it costs no TLS work and no audit line.
- Inbound admission order: Retry → TLS verifier → store check → Hello/Capabilities within 10 s → register → store check again. The last check closes a connection whose device was revoked between the handshake and registration.
- Inbound `peer_rejected` audit lines: at most 20 per minute in one global window. The rest are counted, and the count rides on the next written line.
- rustls's `tls12` feature **is compiled in**: reqwest (hyper-rustls) enables it. Every UCompute config pins TLS 1.3, and a TLS 1.2-only config cannot start a QUIC session. Section 3's "no `tls12`" holds for configs, not for the binary.
- The workload endpoint binds `0.0.0.0:8193` only when networking is on. It is off by default. The only socket type in `ucompute-network/src` is the quinn `Endpoint`.
- The capture test uses an in-process UDP relay that records every datagram, not `tcpdump` (it needs sudo). The scan covers UTF-8 and UTF-16LE. Its positive control finds the canary in the plaintext frames.
- Tests, `crates/ucompute-network/src/tls.rs`: `spki_round_trip_and_rejects_other_algorithms`, `handshake_pinned_keys_succeeds_single_host`, `unpinned_key_rejected`, `revoked_key_rejected`, `revoked_client_cannot_resume_with_cached_session`, `server_key_not_pinned_by_client_rejected`, `wrong_alpn_fails`, `tls12_downgrade_attempt_fails`. `crates/ucompute-network/tests/peer_transport.rs`: `network_disabled_refuses_to_listen`, `handshake_pinned_keys_succeeds_single_host`, `unpinned_key_rejected`, `revoked_key_rejected`, `revoked_key_cannot_reconnect_with_cached_session`, `revoked_during_control_handshake_is_closed`, `rejection_audit_is_rate_limited`. `crates/ucompute-network/src/transport.rs`: `rejection_audit_lines_are_capped_per_minute`. `crates/ucompute-network/tests/invariants.rs`: `no_plaintext_mode_exists`. `crates/ucompute-network/src/lib.rs`: `config_default_is_off_and_scan_finds_both_encodings`. `crates/ucompute-network/tests/remote_single_host.rs`: `packet_capture_contains_no_plaintext_prompt_single_host`, `decode_tpot_overhead_measured_single_host`.
- No test isolates the Retry. Every handshake test against a `Node` passes through it.

### 9.4 Connection dedup (not in the proposal)
Both daemons' sync loops dial each other, so crossed dials are normal. The rule:
- The connection initiated by the **lower `PeerId`** survives. Of two from the same initiator, the older survives.
- Only the initiator of the losing connection retires it, and only once it holds both. So no side cuts a handshake the other is still finishing.
- A retired connection gets no new work. It closes with code 0 at the first 500 ms check that finds no request in flight. A request already running on it finishes.
- `Node::connect` returns the live connection instead of dialling when one exists.
- Known limit: a request opened on the duplicate at the exact moment of an idle check fails with `peer_lost`. A GOAWAY message would fix it.
- Tests, `crates/ucompute-network/src/transport.rs`: `duplicates_resolve_to_the_lower_ids_connection`. `crates/ucompute-network/tests/peer_transport.rs`: `crossed_dials_keep_one_connection_single_host`, `busy_duplicate_is_retired_not_cut_single_host`. `crates/ucompute-api/src/mesh.rs`: `survivor_is_the_connection_the_lower_id_dialled`.

### 9.5 D4 Discovery
The record, as built:
- Service `_ucompute._udp.local.`. Instance = first 12 hex of the id. Host `ucompute-<12 hex>.local.`. SRV port = workload port.
- TXT: `v=1`, `id=<64 hex>`, `pair=0|1`, `pairport=<n>` (only while pairing), `proto=<major>.<minor>` (`1.1` since the E5 hold exchange, 2026-10-22; `1.2` since the WP-04 RPC session messages, ADR-0005 D4), `ts=<unix s>`, `sig`. Nothing else: no hostname beyond SRV, no models, no hardware, no user names.
- `sig` is hex (not base64) Ed25519 over the canonical string `v=1\nid=…\nport=<SRV port>\npair=…\npairport=…\nproto=…\nts=…`. The SRV port is signed, so a replay cannot point a live entry at another port.
- The advertiser re-signs and re-announces every 120 s, so `ts` stays fresh. A specific bind address is the only address advertised; `0.0.0.0` advertises every IPv4 interface address. IPv4 only since 2026-10-23 (round 6): the peer endpoint refuses IPv6 binds at startup, and IPv6 is neither advertised nor browsed.

The browser:
- Drops a record with an unknown version, a missing field, a bad signature, or `ts` more than 300 s from its own clock in either direction.
- Keeps at most 256 entries and evicts stale ones. An entry for a known id at another address is replaced only by a strictly newer `ts`, with one exception: a record with the same `ts` fills an entry that has no dial candidate (mdns-sd resolves a record once per address family, so its first copy may carry only link-local addresses; the 2026-10-23 Mac–Linux finding 1).
- Lists an entry while heard within 175 s. When a listed entry has not been heard for 125 s (a missed re-sign), it re-queries with a fresh browse, at most once per 30 s, checked every 10 s; with every announcement heard it sends nothing beyond mdns-sd's own backoff (RFC 6762 §5.2). Finding 2 of 2026-10-23 (a live peer aged out); tests `the_browser_does_not_re_query_while_every_peer_is_heard`, `a_live_peer_whose_announcements_are_lost_stays_listed`, `a_vanished_peer_costs_two_re_queries_and_leaves_the_list` (synthetic clock).
- Never lists this device's own id (its advert comes back over multicast loopback).
- Offers IPv4 addresses only as dial candidates; loopback and link-local only when nothing else is left; then the lowest address. A peer heard only at IPv6 addresses is listed apart (`unreachable` in `GET /api/peers`) and never dialled.
- Marks `trusted` only when the id is pinned here. That is a label; the TLS verifier makes the trust decision.
- Is off when networking is off, `mdns = false`, or `UCOMPUTE_MDNS=0`.

The daemon dials a pinned device at its fresh mDNS address first, then at the pinned `last_addr`. Discovered or pinned IPv6 addresses are not dialled (the endpoint binds IPv4 only); an address the user types in `POST /api/peers/{id}/connect` is always tried (`dial_order_leaves_out_what_the_endpoint_cannot_dial`). `last_addr` changes only when this device dialled that address and that dial's connection is the one in use.
- Tests, `crates/ucompute-network/src/discovery.rs`: `txt_sign_verify_round_trip`, `tampered_unsigned_and_foreign_records_rejected`, `stale_records_rejected_both_directions`, `disabled_config_is_inert`, `table_is_bounded_and_replays_cannot_redirect`, `pick_addr_takes_the_lowest_ipv4_address`, `rank_addrs_offers_only_ipv4_and_types_the_reason_when_none_is_left`, `pick_addr_never_offers_loopback_or_link_local_when_a_lan_address_exists`. `crates/ucompute-network/tests/discovery.rs`: `two_instances_discover_within_5s_single_host`, `two_processes_discover_within_5s_single_host`, `browser_never_lists_own_id_single_host`. `crates/ucompute-api/tests/mesh.rs`: `peers_list_never_shows_this_device_as_discovered_single_host`. `crates/ucompute-api/src/mesh.rs`: `dial_order_prefers_the_fresh_mdns_address`.

### 9.6 D5 Framing, versioning, capabilities
- Frame = `u32 BE length ‖ protobuf ControlMessage`. The 1 MiB bound is checked before allocation; the writer refuses to send more.
- `Hello{major, minor, ucompute_version, peer_id, nonce}`, connector first. `peer_id` must equal the TLS identity. Major must match (it is also the ALPN), else `protocol_incompatible` naming both versions. A device whose ALPN differs refuses inside the handshake (`no_application_protocol`), before its Hello, so its dialler reads `peer_unauthorized` with the update hint (9.3). Minor = min of the two.
- **`SignedCapabilities` over the exact bytes.** Capabilities travel as `SignedCapabilities{record, signature}`. `record` is the encoded `Capabilities` exactly as sent. `signature` is Ed25519 over `"ucompute/1 capabilities\0" ‖ record`. The receiver checks the signature under the TLS identity over the bytes it received, then decodes, then checks `record.peer_id` equals the TLS identity. Nothing is re-encoded, so a newer minor's unknown fields still verify. The context prefix stops the signature being replayed as an mDNS or revocation signature.
- The `Capabilities` frame is bounded at 64 KiB (`frame_too_large`); a sender refuses to build a larger one. Fields: `schema_version`, `peer_id`, `ucompute_version`, `hardware_json` (exactly `ucompute hardware --json`), `free_memory_bytes`, `engines` (e.g. `llama.cpp b11609 macos-arm64`), `cached_model_sha256`, `groups`, `issued_at`.
- In `control.proto`, tag 2 (the old unsigned Capabilities) and field 10 (the old in-record signature) are reserved. `SignedCapabilities` is tag 9, so an old peer sees an unknown variant.
- The Rust types in `proto.rs` mirror `control.proto` by hand; no generated code, no `protoc`. A test fails when a name or tag differs.
- `Status` is defined but not sent yet. Capabilities are not refreshed after the handshake. The bulk activation frame waits for M4.
- Tests, `crates/ucompute-network/src/proto.rs`: `every_message_round_trips`, `frame_bound_checked_before_allocation`, `unknown_field_tolerated`, `unknown_oneof_variant_tolerated`, `control_proto_mirrors_proto_rs`. `crates/ucompute-network/src/transport.rs`: `negotiate_major_mismatch_is_typed_and_minor_is_min`, `capabilities_signature_covers_the_bytes_sent`, `engines_names_the_pinned_build`. `crates/ucompute-network/tests/peer_transport.rs`: `capabilities_exchanged_after_handshake`, `oversized_capability_message_rejected`, `protocol_major_mismatch_is_typed`, `minor_negotiation_is_min`, `old_new_peer_interop_single_host`, `negotiated_minor_is_min_of_both_single_host` (minor 2 against a minor-1 build, both directions, negotiates 1). Minor 2 (ADR-0005 D4) adds `RpcSessionOpen` (10), `RpcSessionAccept` (11) and `RpcTunnelOpen` (12), sent only at negotiated minor 2 or above; a minor-1 build decodes them as no body (`proto.rs` `minor_1_peer_sees_rpc_frames_as_unknown`) and each is bound to 1 KiB (`tunnel_open_frame_over_1kib_is_frame_too_large`). The minor-1 hold exchange is unchanged (`a_held_peer_of_each_minor_reads_the_hold_single_host` now runs minor 0 and 1 against minor 2).

### 9.7 D6 RPC carriage
Built by WP-04 under ADR-0005 (Proposed), which decides what D6 left open and amends it: a split never falls back to a local run (ADR-0005 D7). The carriage is `crates/ucompute-network/src/rpc.rs` (one QUIC stream per TCP connection, protocol minor 2, 9.6), the stage host engine `crates/ucompute-runtime/src/llamacpp/rpc_server.rs`. ADR-0005 §9 lists the code and its enforcing tests, all unit, synthetic or SINGLE-HOST; no two-machine run exists. M3's Mode B (one whole request on one paired device, 9.10) is unchanged.

### 9.8 D7 Health and the liveness bound
- Defaults: keep-alive **1 s**, idle timeout **4 s** (`keep_alive_ms`, `idle_timeout_ms`).
- Worst case, step by step. The peer dies just after its last datagram, at t0. Our next keep-alive PING goes out at most 1 s later. Sending it restarts our idle timer once (RFC 9000 §10.1: the first ack-eliciting packet sent after a receipt restarts it). Nothing comes back, so the timer fires 4 s after that. Close ≤ t0 + 1 s + 4 s = **5 s**, inside the 6 s of F-02-05.
- The proposal's 2 s / 6 s gives 2 + 6 = 8 s worst case. 6.50 s was measured (`docs/VERIFICATION.md`), so the defaults moved.
- A watcher samples the connection's received-datagram count once per keep-alive interval. Three intervals with nothing → `unhealthy` (about 3 s). Idle-timeout close → `reconnecting`. A deliberate close (revoked, refused, shut down) → `disconnected`.
- Reconnect backoff 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, then 30 s. Supervision (`health::supervise`) stops for good only on a proven `peer_revoked` or `protocol_incompatible` (9.3), or when this device's own store refuses the peer (revoked or unpinned here). An unproven refusal reads `peer_unauthorized` and is retried with the backoff, so a device revoked or unpaired by its peer is redialled with backoff capped at 30 s until this device unpairs or revokes it (780c2b9; only tests call `supervise`). The daemon's sync loop dials every pinned device that has no connection, with its own backoff (`sync_backoff`: 1, 2, 4 … 256, then 300 s, `SYNC_BACKOFF_CAP`; test `sync_backoff_is_exponential_and_capped`), not supervise's 30 s cap.
- Measured in the two-daemon run: SIGKILL of a daemon noticed in 4.855 s (SINGLE-HOST).
- Tests, `crates/ucompute-network/src/health.rs`: `three_misses_then_unhealthy_then_recovers`, `lost_means_reconnecting_until_heartbeat`, `loss_reconnects_deliberate_close_does_not`, `backoff_doubles_and_caps_at_30s`. `crates/ucompute-network/src/transport.rs`: `transport_config_builds_from_config`. `crates/ucompute-network/tests/peer_transport.rs`: `kill_peer_detected_within_bound_single_host`, `sigkill_peer_process_detected_within_bound_single_host`, `partition_detected_and_recovered_single_host`, `supervise_backs_off_on_a_refusal_and_stops_on_its_own_stores` (renamed from `supervise_stops_when_the_peer_refuses`), `supervise_retries_after_an_unproven_refusal_single_host`.

### 9.9 D7 Revocation
Issuing (`POST /api/peers/{id}/revoke`, `ucompute peers revoke`):
- Remove the pin and every group membership. Append `Revocation{seq, peer_id, revoked_by, at_utc, signature}`. The signature is Ed25519 over `"ucompute-revocation/1" ‖ seq (u64 BE) ‖ peer_id ‖ at_utc`.
- Close every connection to the device with close code `RE`. From then on the verifier refuses its key. `pin` refuses a revoked id; only a new pairing restores it.

Acceptance rules for a received record (`PeerStore::apply_revocation`), in this order:
1. Already held → no-op, no audit line.
2. Superseded → refused. `pin_after_pairing` moves this store's revocations of a re-paired id to `superseded`, so a replay cannot undo the re-pair.
3. Issuer revoked here → refused. **Issuer not pinned here → refused.**
4. Signature must verify under the issuer's key.
5. A device revoking itself → refused. Target already revoked here → refused, so one record per target per store.
6. **Issuer and target must share a group here.**

A record that names this device is ignored. A wire record is ignored unless both ids are 32 bytes, the signature is 64 bytes and `at_utc` is at most 64 bytes.

Sending rules (one control loop per connection):
- On every new connection, offer every revocation the store holds; then each new one, local or applied from a peer.
- Offer a record only to its audience: the devices that shared a group with the target here when it was revoked or applied. Never to the target. Never back to a peer that sent it here.
- No audience recorded (revoked before this daemon started): offer it to any peer in one of this device's groups.
- A finished write is not delivery. The record is offered again on every new connection until that peer sends it back. A peer that holds it ignores it silently.
- An applied record closes the target's connections, is audited `peer_revoked` (`source: peer`) and is passed on by the same rules.
- **Across a Disconnect hold (Desktop UI 2.0 E5, protocol minor 1, 2026-10-22).** A hold stops work and connections, not revocations. A device that holds its peer answers the peer's Capabilities with `ErrorMsg{code:"peer_held"}` instead of its own; then the holder sends its due `RevocationMsg` frames and ends its stream, the held side reads to that end, sends its own and ends its stream, and the holder reads to that end and closes with `CLOSE_HELD`. A minor-0 peer gets no frame: the holder sends its Hello, reads and verifies the peer's Capabilities, then closes with `CLOSE_HELD` (0x4844), without its own Capabilities or the exchange (`control.proto` says so since 780c2b9). A Node with no `held_control` hook closes at once; the daemon always sets one. No message or field was added (`control_proto_mirrors_proto_rs` still passes). Each dial from the held device carries the exchange both ways, so delivery waits for that device's next redial (backoff at most 300 s). The exchange checks the store again before each side writes, before each received frame is applied and once more when it ends, including at its 10 s bound, and closes with the store's code when a check fails (so a store change no revoke or unpair call reported closes with the store's code, not `CLOSE_HELD`); held connections are tracked, so revoke, unpair and a peer-sourced revocation close an exchange in progress (F-06-05 parity). The tracked entry is removed when the exchange ends or its future is dropped (`HeldEntry`), so a dial cancelled mid-exchange closes its connection at once. Known limit: two devices that hold each other exchange nothing until one of them connects. The hold is in memory: it survives a settings change that keeps networking on (Sharing) and ends with Connect, unpair, revoke, a peer-sourced revocation of the held device, networking off and on, or a service restart; a Sharing restart carries over holds only on devices still paired. Hold and release run under the `net` lock (`AppState::on_node`) in disconnect, connect, unpair, revoke and a peer-sourced revocation, which releases the hold on the running Node, not the connection's. Disconnect checks the pairing and holds in one `on_node` closure under `peer_writes`; the lock order is `net`, then `peer_writes`, everywhere. Tests, `crates/ucompute-api/tests/mesh.rs`: `revocations_cross_a_hold_both_ways_single_host`, `a_sharing_change_keeps_a_hold_and_networking_off_ends_it_single_host`, `unpairing_ends_a_hold_single_host`, `disconnect_holds_a_device_both_ways_until_connect_single_host`. `crates/ucompute-network/tests/peer_transport.rs`: `a_held_peer_of_each_minor_reads_the_hold_single_host` (two minor-0 redials write exactly one `peer_rejected` line, reason `held`), `a_held_exchange_follows_the_store_single_host`, `the_held_side_of_a_held_exchange_follows_its_store_single_host`, `a_held_exchange_ends_with_the_stores_verdict_at_its_bound_single_host`, `a_cancelled_dial_closes_its_held_exchange_single_host`. `crates/ucompute-api/src/mesh.rs`: `peer_revocations_leave_state_only_for_stored_records_and_end_a_hold`, `a_restart_drops_holds_on_devices_no_longer_paired`, `a_peer_revocation_on_a_replaced_node_ends_the_hold_on_the_running_one`, `a_disconnect_holds_only_a_device_paired_when_held`. The round-3 residuals (off-lock release, non-atomic disconnect, a cancelled dial's held connection left open, untested minor-0 audit and `CLOSE_HELD` value) were closed in 780c2b9. Open (LOW, from the round-5 check): `apply_peer_revocation` still closes connections to the revoked device only on the connection's Node, so one registered on a replacement Node in the same Sharing-restart window is not closed by it.

Known limits: the audience map lives in memory and keeps state only for records this store holds (already, or after `apply_revocation` succeeds), so rejected frames cannot grow it (`peer_revocations_leave_state_only_for_stored_records_and_end_a_hold`). `seq` is per issuer, so peers always send from 0. A record this store never saw can re-revoke a re-paired device that is back in a group with the issuer (fails closed; a pairing epoch would fix it).

### 9.10 Mode B, peer admission and quotas (F-06-02, F-06-04, F-06-07)
Sending side (API `target`, `ucompute run --peer`), in order:
1. `PolicyEngine::evaluate` runs before admission, any load or any network activity (I-05). Local is always allowed. A peer needs privacy `trusted_group`, networking on, the peer pinned and not revoked, and a shared group that allows remote inference.
2. The model hash comes from the local manifest, else the catalog. No hash → `model_not_found`.
3. Use the live connection, else dial (mDNS address, then `last_addr`).
4. Write the `remote_request` audit line, phase `sent`. If it cannot be written, nothing is sent (`io`).
5. `generate_remote` checks the privacy string again before it opens a stream.
6. Phase `finished` is written once, with the outcome and `request_id`, however the request ends.

Serving side, per request stream, in order:
1. At most 8 request streams per connection. The 9th gets `overloaded` without being read.
2. `request_id` must be 1–64 safe characters.
3. `may_serve`: networking on, `serve_peers` on, peer not revoked, pinned, and in a group allowing remote inference; and the request's `privacy` field must be `trusted_group`. A refusal sends an error frame and audits `peer_rejected`; nothing is parsed or loaded.
4. Per-peer token buckets: 120 requests a minute, 4 at once (defaults; `config.json` `peer_quota`).
5. The model id must be a safe name. The requested hash must equal the local manifest's. No substitution.
6. The request is held to the local API's bounds: no raw grammar, `max_tokens ≥ 1`, temperature in [0, 2], top_p in [0, 1], at most 16 stop strings of 256 bytes, a bounded JSON schema, and this device's own timeouts.
7. Engine capacity, never a wait: one permit of the peer share and one free engine slot. The peer share is `min(max_concurrent, engine slots − 1)`, so one slot always stays with local work and a one-slot engine serves no peers. Either missing → `overloaded`.
8. Load, then check the loaded model's hash again.
9. Local work first on a CPU engine (D-026; `crates/ucompute-network/src/local_priority.rs`), only when the loaded engine runs on the CPU (`device_actual == "cpu"`); Metal and other GPU engines skip this step. `config.json` `local_priority`, set with `PUT /api/network`: `refuse_new` (the default, also when absent) refuses the request with `overloaded` ("this device is busy with its own work; retry later") while a local generation runs on that engine or within 2 s of the last one ending, and lets peer generations already running finish; `preempt` (opt-in) does the same and also cancels running peer generations when a local generation starts, each ending with that `overloaded` (this breaks "admitted requests complete", F-08-08, for peers); `none` has no rule (the behaviour before D-026). Local requests are never refused by it. A change applies to the next peer request without restarting the endpoint (audit `local_priority_changed`). The local side counts a generation from its start (after the load) until its stream is dropped.
10. Charge the whole `max_tokens` to the 200,000 tokens-a-minute bucket.
11. Stream. Cancel on a `Cancel` frame or when the client's send side ends for any reason.

Error frames carry the code. For engine and filesystem codes the message is generic, so a peer never sees local paths.

### 9.11 Audit (F-06-10)
- `logs/audit.jsonl`, mode 0600, one JSON line per event. `record` refuses fields named `prompt`, `content`, `messages`, `api_key`, `private_key` or `pkcs8`, and any string over 2 KiB.
- **Rotation.** At 8 MiB the file moves to `audit.1.jsonl`, then `.2`, `.3`; the oldest is dropped. The trail is bounded at about 32 MiB: retained, not append-only forever. Each new file starts with an `audit_rotated` line (`file`, `rotated_bytes`, `dropped_bytes`), so a drop is always visible.
- Kinds a peer cannot produce at will (`pairing_started`, `pairing_succeeded`, `pairing_locked`, `peer_revoked`, `peer_removed`, `privacy_changed`, `network_changed`, `local_priority_changed`, `group_updated`) are also copied to `audit.security.jsonl`, rotated on its own. A flood of refused requests cannot rotate them away. `tail` merges them back.
- Events built: `pairing_{started,succeeded,failed,locked}`, `peer_{connected,rejected,disconnected,revoked,removed}`, `remote_request`, `privacy_changed`, `network_changed`, `local_priority_changed`, `group_updated`, `audit_rotated`. `session_*` and `rpc_tunnel_*` wait for M4. A request that policy stops on the sending side writes no line: nothing left the device.
- Tests, `crates/ucompute-observability/src/lib.rs`: `audit_record_and_tail`, `audit_rejects_content_bearing_fields`, `rotation_keeps_three_files_and_0600`, `tail_reads_across_rotation`, `security_trail_survives_a_request_flood`, `tail_adds_back_security_copies_rotated_away`, `tail_is_bounded_on_a_large_file`, `concurrent_appends_survive_rotation`, `diagnostics_bundle_redacted`.

### 9.12 Error and close codes
- Error codes as proposed: `peer_unauthorized` (403), `peer_revoked` (403), `pairing_failed` (401), `pairing_locked` (429), `peer_lost` (502), `protocol_incompatible` (426), `frame_too_large` (413).
- Added with Desktop UI 2.0 (E5): `peer_held` (403), "the other device disconnected this one".
- QUIC application close codes (since 780c2b9 `close_codes_are_pinned_on_the_wire` pins the value and ASCII bytes of 0, `RE`, `UA`, `PV`, `FT` and `HD`; no test pins the pairing codes `PF` and `PL`, `crates/ucompute-network/src/pairing.rs`): `RE` 0x5245 revoked, `UA` 0x5541 unauthorized, `PV` 0x5056 protocol, `FT` 0x4654 frame too large, `PF` 0x5046 pairing failed, `PL` 0x504C pairing locked, `HD` 0x4844 held (E5: read as `peer_held` by builds that know it when it follows the holder's Hello, as `peer_unauthorized` by a minor-1 build when a minor-0 holder closes before its Hello, and as `peer_lost` "closed by peer" by builds without E5), 0 normal. Before the dialler has read the device's Hello every close but a plain loss reads `peer_unauthorized` (9.3), `PV` and `FT` included since 780c2b9 (before, a `PV` or `FT` close after this side's handshake kept its diagnosis).
- Tests, `crates/ucompute-network/src/transport.rs`: `connection_errors_map_to_stable_codes`, `close_codes_are_pinned_on_the_wire`. `crates/ucompute-network/src/remote.rs`: `error_codes_round_trip_through_their_strings`.

### 9.13 Desktop: dev-only daemon URL
- `?daemon=http://127.0.0.1:<port>` (or `http://localhost:<port>`) points one browser tab at another local daemon, so two tabs can drive two daemons in SINGLE-HOST UI testing.
- Only plain `http`, only those two hosts, only a port in 1–65535, no path or query. Anything else is ignored.
- Only when `import.meta.env.DEV` is true. Production builds compile it out and ask the Tauri shell (`daemon_info`). Diagnostics labels a chosen URL "development only".
- Tests: `apps/desktop/src/test/devdaemon.test.tsx` (suites `devDaemonUrl` and `app with ?daemon=`).

### 9.14 Where the code differs from sections 2–8
| Proposal | Built |
|---|---|
| keep-alive 2 s, idle 6 s | 1 s and 4 s; worst case 5 s (9.8) |
| SQLite `peers` / `revoked` tables | `identity/peers.json` + `peers.json.lock` (9.1) |
| mDNS `sig` base64 over the other TXT values | hex over a canonical string that includes the SRV port (9.5) |
| `signature` field inside `Capabilities` | `SignedCapabilities` envelope over the exact bytes (9.6) |
| generated prost code via `scripts/gen_proto.sh` | hand-mirrored `proto.rs`, checked by a test (9.6) |
| rustls without `tls12` | `tls12` compiled in through reqwest; every config pins TLS 1.3 (9.3) |
| `Status` every 10 s | defined, not sent (9.6) |
| any group member may revoke any other | issuer pinned here and sharing a group with the target here (9.9) |
| one connection assumed per peer | crossed dials resolved by the lower-id rule (9.4) |
| `tcpdump` capture | in-process UDP relay capture (9.3) |
| D6 RPC carriage, local fallback allowed | built under ADR-0005, no fallback (9.7) |
| test names in section 5 | the names in this section (e.g. `downgrade_attempt_fails` is `tls12_downgrade_attempt_fails`) |

### 9.15 Still open
- **Two-machine evidence (B-002).** Everything above ran on one Mac. Real LAN mDNS, Wi-Fi jitter against the 4 s idle timeout, and a kernel packet capture on a LAN interface are untested.
- **`tls12` compiled in** through reqwest. No UCompute config enables it, but nothing in the build stops a future config from doing so.
- **`spake2` 0.4.0** is unaudited and, by its own statement, probably not constant-time. One-time 120 s codes, the lockout and transcript-only use limit the exposure. Track 0.5.
- No test isolates the QUIC Retry. The pairing endpoint has no Retry.
- Private key bytes are not zeroized in memory.
- The `peer_rejected` cap is one global window, so a flood hides other rejections for that minute (the count is kept).
- The revocation audience map is in memory (9.9).
- Hold and refusal residuals from the 2026-10-22 security checks were closed in 780c2b9 (9.3, 9.8, 9.9). Left, LOW: a peer-sourced revocation closes connections only on the connection's Node during a Sharing restart (9.9); a device revoked or unpaired by its peer is redialled by `supervise` with backoff capped at 30 s (9.8; only tests call `supervise`; the daemon's sync loop redials every pinned device with backoff up to 300 s, as before); a genuinely newer-major device that closes before its Hello reads `peer_unauthorized` with an update hint, not `protocol_incompatible` (9.3).
- The QR carries one address; a multi-homed host may pick the wrong LAN.

### 9.16 Frozen protocol identifiers (D-028, D-029, 2026-10-29)
The rename replaced every former identifier with no compatibility layer (D-028): a build that still carries the former
names and a UCompute build share no ALPN and refuse each other in the TLS handshake. The sections above use the current
names (D-030); the code uses `ucompute/1` and `ucompute-pair/1` (ALPNs), `ucompute-pair:v1:` (pairing payload),
`ucompute-pair/1 confirm` (pairing key-export label), `ucompute/1 capabilities\0` and `ucompute-revocation/1`
(signature contexts, still distinct from each other and from the mDNS advert's `v=1` canonical form),
`_ucompute._udp` (mDNS) and `ucompute.v1` (protobuf package; field numbers and wire bytes unchanged, the Hello and
Capabilities version field is `ucompute_version`). These are frozen interface names (D-029): they change
only with a protocol major version recorded here, never with the product's name. Versioning between UCompute builds
is unchanged: major in the ALPN, `min(minor)` negotiation, typed `protocol_incompatible`. Tests:
`crates/ucompute-network/src/tls.rs` `wrong_alpn_fails` refuses any other ALPN (a foreign `other/1` and `other-pair/1`,
`ucompute/0`, `ucompute-pair/0`, the other endpoint's); `crates/ucompute-network/src/pairing.rs` refuses any other
`<name>-pair:` payload by name (`other-pair:v1:`, `ucompute-pair:v2:`), so the former identifiers are refused too.
